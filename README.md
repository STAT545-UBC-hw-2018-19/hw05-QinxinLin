## Reflections: 

Actually, I think the difficulty of this assignment is medium, but I still struggled for a long time on `plotly` section. I want to show plotly figure in my report, but it does not work because it only has html output. Then I change the output for RMD file to html_document, it still cannot show up in html file in github. I donot know why and finally I gave up. I just compare the differene between ggplot graphs and plotly graphs. Another thing I am confused with is pdf file. In the last part, I want to save the figure as a pdf file but it cannot embedded in my report in github.
